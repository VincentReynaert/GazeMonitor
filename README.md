### Supported eye trackers ###

GazeMonitor has been developed and tested using **Tobii eyeX** controller and **GazeSDK**. In theory, it will work unmodified with every Tobii's tracker that supports GazeSDK. However, testing with Tobii REX showed that calibration isn't working, because REX cannot track a single eye while the other is covered. Other trackers haven't been tested. 

### Build instructions ###

Prerequisites:

* Windows machine with Visual Studio
* .NET 4.5
* Tobii eyeX Controller (recommended eye tracker)
* USB 3.0 (if using eyeX)

Make sure eyeX controller works on your system. Install all necessary drivers and run eyeX application supplied by Tobii. Test if eye tracking works as expected. 
When done, make sure eyeX application is turned off, because it can interfere with GazeMonitor.

Steps:

1. Download and unpack GazeSDK for Windows from [Tobii](http://developer.tobii.com/). Choose the file according to your architecture. 
2. Clone (or download and unpack) GazeMonitor repository.
3. Add all files from the "lib" subfolder in GazeSDK to GazeMonitor project folder.
4. Open the GazeMonitor solution file in Visual Studio.
5. Right click on Gaze Monitor project -> Add -> Reference... -> Browse.. and select "Tobii.Gaze.Core.Net.dll".
6. Right click on Gaze Monitor project -> Add -> Existing Item... and select "TobiiGazeCore32.dll" or "TobiiGazeCore64.dll" depending on your architecture. In properties under "Copy to output directory" select "Copy if newer".
7. Select your architecture under Configuration Manager. "Any CPU" won't work.
8. Click "Start".
